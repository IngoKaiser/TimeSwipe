In the settings file should be the main settings like gains, bridge voltage and offsets for the beginning. But it has to be extendible.
The SAM has to check the settings file, if these are legal values and send a feedback to the rPi.
The other commands have to be checked too.
If the rPi sends a value for an output for example, the rPi asks in the next step for this value.
So on the rPi it can be checked, if the setting has been succesfully made.
There have to be interrupts/events on both sides (SAM and rPi), because the rPi has to be informed immediately, if something changes, 
if for example the button is pressed or a sensor is taken off.
Is it possible to detect, if a sensor is connected or not?
